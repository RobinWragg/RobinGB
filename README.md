# RobinGB
A Game Boy emulator in development for low-power devices, written in ANSI-C.

With Super Mario Land as a benchmark, RobinGB runs at approximately 80% of full speed on a 240MHz MCU such as an overclocked Teensy 3.6 (ARM Cortex-M4). This is slow mainly due the rasteriser. Optimisation is planned, but current focus is on adding support for more games.

## Inexhaustive list of working games
Asteroids, Bomb Jack, Boxxle, Brainbender, Bubble Ghost, Castelian, Catrap, Cool Ball, Crystal Quest, Dr. Mario, Flipull, Heiankyo Alien, Kwirk, Loopz, Missile Command, Motocross Maniacs, Pipe Dream, Q Billion, Serpent, Shanghai, Super Mario Land, Tasmania Story, Tennis, Tesserae, Tetris, World Bowling.
